# Malware-C2-Detection

## Objective

I am working as a Tier 1 Security Analyst for a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Today I'm tasked with monitoring network alerts. The objective is to investigate and validate the network security alert indicating the detection of a network trojan and a potential corporate privacy violation. This involves analyzing the alert generated by an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to understand the nature and context of the detected activity. The goal is to assess whether the alert indicates a legitimate security threat or if it is a benign event mistakenly flagged as malicious.

Project: Misc activity, A Network Trojan Was Detected, and Potential Corporate Privacy Violation.
